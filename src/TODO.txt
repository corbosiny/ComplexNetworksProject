TODO:

High level engine changes:
- Add in reachable by attacker node set -- Done
- Game is over when no more reachable nodes -- Done
- Add in quarantined/safe node set, updated on labels -- Done 
- High suspicion quarantines a node, removes all edges, medium removes most recent edges, update graph will include edges changing  -- Done
- Find way to label infect nodes -- Done
- Generate background traffic only to and from non quarantined nodes -- Done
- Organize messages based on receiving nodes -- Done

Defender changes:
- Defender can only read so many messages in each queue, determined by size of queues -- done
    - 1  - .1 sigmoid()
- Chose message metadata maybe done?

Attacker changes:
- Attacker fed in who it can reach and message traffic going to each node, outputs node index on who to attack, also idle attack -- in progress
- Calculate reward for each node in the network for connecting, zero if cant reach -- Done
- Train it to output 0 for unreachable nodes -- Done


- write quarantineNode/infectNode  -- done
    - update Reachable node list   -- done
- write calculate infection score  -- done
- add traffic flow amounts to attacker inputs -- done
- fix generating traffic to only existing edges -- done
- add probability to inspection of messages -- done
- edit train for attacker -- done
- update proper indicies for message metadata parsing -- done
- edit train for defender -- done

Debug checklist:
- Message -- Done
- Agent -- Done
- Defender -- Done
- Attacker -- Done
- Game Engine

- m3 scalability?? - Discuss later, start with 50 nodes
